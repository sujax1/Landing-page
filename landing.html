            <h1> About:-</h1>
        <p>              Santiniketan, popularly known today as a university town,
             a hundred miles to the north of Kolkata, was originally an ashram built by Debendranath Tagore,
              where anyone, irrespective of caste and creed, could come and spend time meditating on the one Supreme God. 
              Debendranath, who was father of the Poet, Rabindranath, was also known as Maharshi (which means one who is both saint and sage) 
              was a leading figure of the Indian Renaissance. In a trust deed prepared in 1888, he declared:
               'Apart from worshipping the Formless, no community may worship any idol depicting god, 
               man, or animals; neither may anyone arrange sacrificial fires or rituals in Santiniketan....
                No insult to any religion or religious deity will be allowed here. The sermons given here will 
                be such that will be appropriate to the worship of the Creator and Father and will help in ethics,
                 benevolence and brotherhood...' It was in this area that the Maharshi had a spiritual realization
                  while meditating under a glade of Chhatim trees (Alstonia scholaris), which were the only vegetation 
                  in this arid land of Birbhum. These trees still stand with a plaque that says, He is the repose of my 
                  life, the joy of my heart, the peace of my soul. Chhatimtala as it is called is the spot that symbolizes 
                  the starting point of Santiniketan, which was to become his son Rabindranath's home and base fro activity.
                   It is considered to be a hallowed spot and prayer services are held here on very special days. Rabindranath, 
                   too, like his father before him would sit in meditation here, under the chhatim trees during sunset.</p>
